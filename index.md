# $ Projects
* [Titanic Survival Exploration](https://github.com/rigved/udacity-machine-learning/tree/master/projects/titanic_survival_exploration):
    * Developed a Decision Tree classifier to predict the survival rate of Titanic's passengers.
    * Eliminated unnecessary features of the available training dataset. Thus, the classifier used only those features that contributed to the outcome.
* [Boston Housing](https://github.com/rigved/udacity-machine-learning/tree/master/projects/boston_housing):
    * Developed an optimal regression model to predict the price of a house in Boston.
    * Utilized various Machine Learning techniques to minimize under-fitting and over-fitting the training data.
* [Student Intervention](https://github.com/rigved/udacity-machine-learning/tree/master/projects/student_intervention):
    * Developed a classification model to predict students' probability to graduate.
    * Evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen model, given the available data.
* [Customer Segments](https://github.com/rigved/udacity-machine-learning/tree/master/projects/creating_customer_segments):
    * Developed an unsupervised model to explain variation in the different types of customers. This information would help the wholesale distributor to optimize its delivery service.
    * Utilized various data pre-processing techniques to find hidden relationships. This helped to understand consumer purchasing behaviors.
* [SmartCab](https://github.com/rigved/udacity-machine-learning/tree/master/projects/smartcab):
    * Developed a Smartcab driving agent that navigated towards a goal using Reinforcement Learning.
    * Constructed an optimized Q-Learning agent to reach the end goal every time. The agent placed high importance on safety guidelines and reliability.
